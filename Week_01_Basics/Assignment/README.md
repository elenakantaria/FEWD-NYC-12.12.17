# HTML and CSS Basics

### Description

For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first
website. Take what you've learned from class and build a resume webpage for yourself.

### Technical Requirements

- Use a unique `title` and a single unique `h1` tag
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style your pages
- Select at least 5 elements on the page and apply at least 5 different css
properties (`font-size`, `color`, `font-family`, `background`, `text-decoration`) to
these elements
- Use at least 6 different HTML tags (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`,
`ul`, `ol`, `a`, `img`) on your pages
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across your .html and .css files
- Indent nested elements to increase your code's readability

### Evaluation / Submission

You will create a new repository on GitHub called "resume-website" and push
your code to this new repository when you are ready to submit. Your classmate(s)
will peer code-review your assignment and grade each technical requirement and provide a numeric grade on a scale:
does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations
(2).  The maximum possible score on this assignment is 12/12.
