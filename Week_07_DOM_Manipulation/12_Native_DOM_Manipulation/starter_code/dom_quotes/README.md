## Exercise - Selecting DOM elements

This is an exercise in finding elements on the page (in the DOM).

Your task is to write javascript in the script file to retrieve the objects which represent these elements. Once you've selected them, `console.log` them so you can confirm you're correct.

Start with these:

1. Select the `<body>`
- Select the `<header>`
- Select all of the elements with class "quote"
- Select all of the subject elements
- Select the navigation links
- Select all the quotes in the "life" section.
- Using relative selection, select the `<p>` element containing the second Mark Twain quote
- Do the same using a query selector
- Select the 'Quotes About Motivation' heading
