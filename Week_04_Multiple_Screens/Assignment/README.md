# FEWD Week #4: Responsive Design

## Description

Startup Matchmaker's user count has grown, and the number of users accessing the site from a mobile device has surprised everyone, even by today's standards. The product managers at Startup Matchmaker have asked you to return to the project and make their site responsive so it renders nicely on mobile devices. They had one of their internal developers make a few tweaks to your source code, and they have given you the new HTML / CSS files to work from. Using these starter files, build out the mobile layouts for the homepage.

### Real-World Applications

- Use media queries to render different CSS files according to screen size
- Revisit applications and projects to iterate on and improve code you've written

## Technical Requirements

- Use media queries at a 768px breakpoint
- As a user changes the size of a browser window:

  - Content remains in appropriate HTML elements
  - Content remains visible to the user
  - Fonts change size appropriately
  - Margins and padding change size appropriately
  - Content does not overlap
  - Changes to a single-column layout when appropriate

#### Bonus

Add different media queries for a 1000px breakpoint and a 480px breakpoint

### Evaluation / Submission

- Create a new Github repository called "startup_matchmaker_responsive" and clone it to your local machine.
- Copy all of the code within the starter code directory to your repository.
- Your task is to match the responsive layout in the image. Be sure to refer to the rubric and make sure you meet all of the requirements.

## Final Project - Milestone 1

Over the next week you will also be required to brainstorm ideas for your final project. Final project proposal with rough wireframes will be **due at the beginning of Week 6**.
