# Lesson 04 - Classes, IDs and Floating Layouts

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
- Understand what HTML classes and IDs are and how they are different.
- Use classes and IDs as CSS selectors to style web pages.
- Utilize the CSS `float` property to arrange elements and create more complex layouts.

## Classes and IDs

#### IDs
The id global attribute defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS). [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id)

#### Classes
The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allows CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the DOM method `document.getElementsByClassName`.

## Floating Elements
Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property has become one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats)
