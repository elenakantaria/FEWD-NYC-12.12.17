# FEWD Final Project Guidelines

## Project Submission

To submit your final project code and components, create a new Github repository. You can name it whatever you'd like, just be sure to send Paris a link to your repo.

#### Due Tuesday, 01/23/18 - Proposal and Wireframes

- Create a `README.md` file in the root of your final project repo. Include a brief description of your project - what it is, why your are interested in building it, etc.

- Create a directory in the root of your project repo called `wireframes`. Add your initial wireframe images to this directory and then commit push them up to Github for review. If your wireframes are hand-drawn, you can scan them or take pictures. Just make sure they are clearly legible and are formatted as either PNG or JPG.
